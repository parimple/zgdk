# Poetry Lock File Issue

## Status
Poetry lock file cannot be created due to dependency conflicts.

## Conflict Details
There is an incompatible version requirement for `protobuf`:
- `crewai==0.130.0` requires `protobuf >=5.0,<6.0`
- `google-generativeai==0.3.2` requires `protobuf <5.0`

## Current Solution
The project continues to use `requirements.txt` with pinned versions that are known to work together.

## Future Options
1. Wait for updates to either library that resolve the conflict
2. Use an older version of crewai that is compatible with protobuf <5.0
3. Find an alternative to google-generativeai that supports protobuf >=5.0
4. Remove one of the conflicting dependencies if not essential
