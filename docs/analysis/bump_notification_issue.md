# Bump Notification System Analysis

## Summary
The bump notification system in the zgdk Discord bot has been analyzed. The system is properly detecting DISBOARD and other bump service messages, but there was a critical bug preventing notifications from being sent.

## Issue Found
The main issue was a field name mismatch:
- The handlers were trying to access `db_member.bypass_expiry`
- The actual field in the Member model is `voice_bypass_until`

## System Components

### 1. Bump Event Handler (`/cogs/events/bump/bump_event.py`)
- Main listener for all bot messages
- Routes messages to appropriate handlers based on bot ID
- Includes debug logging for DISBOARD messages
- Properly detects bump messages from all configured services

### 2. Service Handlers (`/cogs/events/bump/handlers.py`)
- **DisboardHandler**: Processes DISBOARD bump messages
- **DzikHandler**: Processes Dzik (Top.gg) bump messages  
- **DiscadiaHandler**: Processes Discadia vote messages
- **DiscordServersHandler**: Processes DiscordServers bump messages
- **DSMEHandler**: Processes DSME vote messages

### 3. Notification Flow
1. Bot message received → `on_message` listener
2. Message routed to appropriate handler based on bot ID
3. Handler extracts user from interaction or embed
4. Handler checks cooldown via NotificationRepository
5. If not on cooldown:
   - Adds bypass time to member
   - Sends thank you embed
   - Sends marketing message
   - Logs notification

### 4. Database Models
- **Member**: Has `voice_bypass_until` field for tracking bypass time
- **NotificationLog**: Tracks cooldowns and opt-outs per service

## Fix Applied
Fixed the field name from `bypass_expiry` to `voice_bypass_until` in:
1. `/cogs/events/bump/handlers.py` - Line 33, 35, 38, 43
2. `/cogs/events/bump/bump_event.py` - Line 276, 277, 279

## Verification Steps
1. Docker container rebuilt successfully
2. Bump module loads without errors
3. DISBOARD messages are being detected (confirmed via logs)
4. The error "Member' object has no attribute 'bypass_expiry'" has been resolved

## Expected Behavior After Fix
When a user bumps the server:
1. A thank you message should appear with the amount of bypass time earned
2. A marketing message should follow, suggesting other bump services
3. The user's bypass time should be extended in the database
4. Cooldown should prevent spam notifications

## Additional Observations
- Bumps are happening in the `bots³` channel (ID: 960665312200626198)
- The system includes proper cooldown management per service
- Debug logging is active and helpful for troubleshooting
- The guild ID is properly configured (960665311701528596)

## Recommendations
1. Monitor the logs for successful bypass time additions
2. Verify notifications are appearing in the correct channel
3. Consider adding a test command to simulate bumps for easier debugging
4. Ensure the bot has permissions to send messages in bump channels
